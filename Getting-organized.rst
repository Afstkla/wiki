 Things Network! We would love to help you to connect your city/area! On this page you will find the basic first steps on your road to succes

Team
Having a team makes setting up your gateways much easier and more fun. Therefore I strongly recommend finding a few people that share your passion and can help setting up and managing your part of the network. 

As soon as you have set up your team, let me (ttn [at] tomoostvogels [dot] nl) know so I can set you up with a campaign page (e.g. http://thethingsnetwork.org/c/amsterdam) and category on the forum. This will help you gather traction with sponsors and government. 

Hardware
There is a lot of LoRaWAN hardware out there. Here is a short overview, with specifications: http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewGateways for gateways and http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewNodes for nodes.

As you probably know, we are starting a Kickstarter to get you hardware at an affordable price: http://thethingsnetwork.org/landing/kickstarter If you have not done so already, enter your email address on the page to be the first to know more. We are planning on shipping the hardware in May.

Connecting to TTN
Without a connection to the network, your hardware is just a box with blinking lights. This page will get you started: http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Software/Overview
