We would love to help you to connect your city/area! On this page you will find the basic first steps on your road to success

# Step 1: get inspired
Read through our [manifest](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/Manifest) and a small list of [existing use cases](../Use-cases)

# Step 2: Gather your team
Having a team makes setting up your gateways much easier and more fun. Therefore I strongly recommend finding a few people that share your passion and can help setting up and managing your part of the network. 

As soon as you have set up your team, you can contact us for a [campaign page](Campaign-page)

# Step 3: Hard- and software
On [[GettingStarted]] you can find the details on the hardware and how to connect it to the TTN network. 
If your answer is not (yet) on this wiki, please consult the [forum](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org) and do not hesitate to ask your questions!

# Step 4: Make your presence known
Without connected nodes your gateway gets lonely. On the forum there is an [extensive topic](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/t/integrated-communications-for-teams-to-advertise-their-local-presence-best-practices-and-suggested-framework/247) about making your presence known
