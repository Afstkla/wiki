We would love to help you to connect your city/area! On this page you will find the basic first steps on your road to succes

## Team
Having a team makes setting up your gateways much easier and more fun. Therefore I strongly recommend finding a few people that share your passion and can help setting up and managing your part of the network. 

As soon as you have set up your team, let me (ttn [at] tomoostvogels [dot] nl) know so I can set you up with a campaign page (e.g. [Amsterdam](http://thethingsnetwork.org/c/amsterdam)) and category on the [forum](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org). This will help you gather traction with other teammember, companies, sponsors and government. 

## Hard- and software
On [[GettingStarted]] you can find the details on the hardware and how to connect it to the TTN-network. 

## Other questions
If your answer is not on it (yet), please consult the [forum](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org) and do not hesistate to ask your questions!
