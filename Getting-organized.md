We would love to help you to connect your city/area! On this page you will find the basic first steps on your road to success

# Step 1: get inspired
Read through our [manifest](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/Manifest) and a small list of [use cases](Use-cases)

# Step 2: Gather your team
Having a team makes setting up your gateways much easier and more fun. Therefore I strongly recommend finding a few people that share your passion and can help setting up and managing your part of the network. 

# Step 3: Hard- and software
On [[GettingStarted]] you can find the details on the hardware and how to connect it to the TTN network. 
If your answer is not (yet) on this wiki, please consult the [forum](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org) and do not hesitate to ask your questions!

Without connected nodes your gateway gets lonely. On the forum there is an [extensive topic](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/t/integrated-communications-for-teams-to-advertise-their-local-presence-best-practices-and-suggested-framework/247) about making your presence known

# Step 4: Make your presence known
As soon as you have set up your team and you have decided which gateway you want to use, contact us for a [campaign page](Campaign-page). Time to find people and companies that want to use TTN or sponsor other gateways.

# Step 5: Choose a platform
