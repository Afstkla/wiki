# Getting involved with an existing Community

The easiest way to get involved is simply to join an existing community. You can find a list of communities on the [main website of The Things Network](http://thethingsnetwork.org/#communities).

# Starting a new Community

If there's no community in your area yet, you can start a new community. There are a few ingredients for building a successful community:

* A community page on thethingsnetwork.org
* Good communication channels for your community
* Getting together and talk, discuss, build things and have fun

## Community Page

To set up your community page on thethingsnetwork.org, we need a few details that you can submit using [this form](http://thethingsnetwork.org/start-a-community/). Before you fill in the form, you should ask yourself a couple of questions:

* For what city or region are you setting up a community?
* What do you want to accomplish with the community?
* Do you have a couple of beautiful, high quality photos that represent your city or region (that you're allowed to use)?
* Do you already have some community members?
* How can potential community members contact you?

## Communication

Communication is the most important thing in a community. Existing communities use [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [forums](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/c/regions), [mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/). Probably the easiest way is to join the official [The Things Network Community Slack](http://slack.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create dedicated channels (chat rooms) for your community.

## Getting Together

The most amazing things happen when you come together with your community. Start a new [Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/) or [Part-up](https://part-up.com/tribes/thethingsnetwork), visit meetups of other communities and learn from each other.
