compile a list of most frequently asked questions here. Like:

### Are you a network operator? -> no, we're a community etc etc
..

### Do I have to pay money to use the network? -> no, but needs hardware
..

### Do I need to buy a gateway / router to get started? -> not if any is in range
..

### Is it secure to connect gateway to our home/company network?
..

### Can any gateway owner read packages sent via TTN?
..

### Who has to buy a server (Network Server - NS)?
..

### How fast is the network? What data-rate can we use?
The network uses LoRaWAN, which was developed for long-range data-networks that
don't need a constant connection. The protocol allows for different speeds and
data packet sizes, all relatively small and depending on various instances.
Maximum packet sizes vary between **55 and 222 bytes**. Air time is often
restricted to 1%; therefore, packets can be sent every **5 seconds up to 4 minutes**,
depending on packet size, distance from gateway and other factors.

### How do I connect to the network? Does this work on my smartphone?
LoRaWAN is a new technology that - like wifi or bluetooth - needs special
hardware in order to connect. It's meant for `things` rather than human-operated
devices, so it won't work on your smartphone. You'll need to buy `things` or
nodes supporting LoRaWAN.
