# Gateways for The Things Network

Which gateway is right for you, depends a lot on your use-case and budget. Unfortunately, our [[The Things Gateway|Hardware/Gateways/The-Things-Gateway]] is not shipping until Summer 2016, so until then, you should use one of the alternatives. We know many people that are quite happy with their [[Kerlink|Hardware/Gateways/Kerlink]], [[Multi-Tech|Hardware/Gateways/Multi-Tech]] or [[Lorank|Hardware/Gateways/Lorank]] gateway. There are some other options, and you can even [[build your own|Hardware/Gateways/DIY]].

We also love the [comparison matrix](https://www.loriot.io/lora-gateways.html) our friends at Loriot built.

# Accessories

After you figure out which gateway you want, you probably also want to take a look at accessories such as [[antennas|Hardware/Gateways/Antennas]] and
[[lightning protection|Hardware/Gateways/Lightning-Protection]].
