# Current Network

An early diagram of the current network is shown here:
![data flow overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/TheThingsNetwork/docs/imgs/ttn_prototype_data_flow.png)

Note that this is still a prototype, while we're working on the first version
of the new [[Architecture]].


## Gateways
Here's an overview of the current network nodes and gateways.
As it's made manually, it's most likely out to date. We'll work on some automated google maps soon.
