Until there is an official API for registering blocks
of nodes, let's do it informally here by hand. To
claim your address space, simply add a 255 nodes block
below (please add consecutively and only claim 255 addresses at a time).

**Blocks**

NwkID 1:

03:FF:xx:xx reserved for testing

02:00:00:xx to 00:00:FF:xx reserved

02:01:00:xx to 00:01:FF:xx 1st 256 assigned blocks

02:02:00:xx to 00:02:FF:xx 2nd 256 blocks

etc.
