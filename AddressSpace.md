Until there is an official API for registering blocks
of nodes, let's do it informally here by hand. To
claim your address space, simply add a 255 nodes block
below (please sort alphabetically on address block and
only claim 255 addresses at a time).

## Registered Addresses
| Address block    |-| Who claimed it?        |
|------------------|-|------------------------|
| AA:FF:xx:xx      | | *reserved for testing* |
| DE:AD:BE:xx      | | turiphro               |
| ??:??:??:xx      | | *you?*                 |
