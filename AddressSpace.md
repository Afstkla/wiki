Until there is an   official API for registering blocks
of nodes, let's do it informally here by hand. To
claim your address space, simply add a 255 nodes block
below (please add consecutively and only claim 255 addresses at a time).

NwkID 1 is used until TTN gets an official address space allocation. Please _only register 
addresses on this page that fall inside NwkID 1_, that means starting with '02:'. 

**Blocks**

NwkID 1:

03:FF:xx:xx reserved for testing

03:FE:xx:xx reserved for broadcast testing

02:00:00:xx to 00:00:FF:xx reserved

02:01:00:xx to 00:01:FF:xx 1st 256 assigned blocks

02:02:00:xx to 00:02:FF:xx 2nd 256 blocks

## Broadcasting
  
03:FE:BC:BC                 General Broadcast Channel (by popcorn)
