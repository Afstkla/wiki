# wiki

This is The Things Network wiki.

**NOTE**: this github repo is just an hourly synced copy of the "real" wiki, which is hosted at:

## http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/

Feel free to fork this repo for your own administration, but don't expect changes to propagate
back into the wiki. That is, it should all work in theory, but it's easier to edit on the wiki
hosted externally.
