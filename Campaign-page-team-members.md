# Campaign page team members 
Each campaign page has one imitator and at least one team member. Team members are shown at the bottom left of the page. 

The TTN-team can add new members, just provide the following:

* name: the name of the team member
* mail address: so we can contact him/her
* profile picture
* status: is this person the imitator or a team member?
