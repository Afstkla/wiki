#Setting up an outdoor gateway
Only a few steps need to be taken to set up an outdoor gateway.

1. Get a gateway for either indoor or outdoor usage. [This link](http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewGateways) shows a list of gateways.

2. When an outdoor gateways is chosen, find a spot where it can be placed and attached to a fixed object. The higher the gateways is placed, the better its reach. 
<br/><br/> *In case the gateway is placed on the roof of a building in the city center or on a monumental building, review the governmental regulations around placing antennas. In some cases there need to be applied for a permit.*

3. For setting up a Kerlink, attach the antenna by screwing it on the gateway. The antenna has a cable of around 1 meter, this makes it possible to place the antenna even higher on the building.

4. Connect the gateways to the router via an ethernet (UTP) cable or via Wifi and connect it to the power grid. If the gateway uses PoE (Power over Ethernet), there is no need for an additional adapter.

5. The gateway needs to be configured in order to connect it to the network of TTN. This can be done by installing a TTN Packet Forwarder via a usb or via the internet (UTP / wifi). More information around this can be found [here](http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewGateways)].

6. Register the gateway on a personal account via the website: [www.thethingsnetwork.org](http://thethingsnetwork.org/)

7. Rarely, there is a need to update the software. Depending on the way the gateway is configured, this can be done from any place with an internet connection, or only from the place with the similar LAN of the gateway.
